# Mobile app testing checklist

A testers brain requires a lot of creativity and the no of scenarios that we test on a day to day basis are innumerable. Expecting the brain to remember all the ways of testing an application whether it be from a mobile, a web or an API interface is tough and an overhead.

These checklists are a brain dump of the different ways that I approach and think about testing apps in different conditions and hopefully reduces the cognitive load to remember these.


## App gestures

What actions can the user do on the app?

- [ ] Swipes
- [ ] Taps
- [ ] Pinches
- [ ] Type
- [ ] Hold
- [ ] Drag and drops

## Visuals

Do the icons, images look okay and help the user in using the app?

- [ ] Does the apps, icons, images convey the correct info to the user?
- [ ] Images should fit the screen

## Push notifications

Does the app generate and handle push notifications correctly?

- [ ] Correct text for different app states?
- [ ] Tap on PN to redirect user to correct screen

## Interruptions

How does the app respond to any interruptions while use?

- [ ] If put in background and resumed
- [ ] If killed and restarted
- [ ] If Incoming call, message, PN causes the user to switch context

## App permissions

Does the app require correct level of permissions and the behavior around those

- [ ] Behavior when the user grants/revokes certain permissions
- [ ] Only necessary permissions are requested

## User Input

Does the app handle different types of inputs and allows user to enter invalid inputs?

### Boundary values

Check for value/length as per below:

- [ ] min
- [ ] min - 1
- [ ] max
- [ ] max + 1

### Inputs

- [ ] Overflow values (Enter value > max allowed value for a given data type of the field)
- [ ] Null/Empty/Blank
- [ ] Non ASCII characters (Swedish/Russian)
- [ ] Copy paste values
- [ ] Special Chars (!@#$%^&*())
- [ ] Leading or trailing whitespaces
- [ ] Line breaks
- [ ] String characters (If numeric) and numeric (If String)
- [ ] Numeric separators (1000, 1.000, 1,000)

### Date and Times

- [ ] Future datetimes
- [ ] Past datetimes
- [ ] Invalid datetimes (32 days, 13 month, 25 hours, 61 minutes, 61 second)
- [ ] Holidays
- [ ] Weekends
- [ ] Leap days
- [ ] Timezones
- [ ] Different datetime formats

## Onboarding flows

- [ ] UX when a first time user engages with the app (Introduction flows)
- [ ] These flows should be shown only a certain no of times
- [ ] How do we introduce user to new features in the product? Ease of comprehension
- [ ] Check different user personas

## App upgrades

- [ ] Does app work when upgraded to a new version?
- [ ] Can user proceed with any in-flight flows after app upgrades?

## Screen sizes

- [ ] How does the app look when opened in devices with different screen sizes (4, 5, 6 inches)
- [ ] Does it look okay on a tablet?
- [ ] Does it look okay on a Desktop/Laptop screen (If applicable)

## Feature Toggles

How does the app respond to future toggles

- [ ] Feature turned ON
- [ ] Feature turned OFF
- [ ] Any data created with old/new app should be compatible and should not lead to app crashes

## Error conditions

- [ ] Correct error messages are displayed in different conditions
- [ ] CTA (Call to action) should be as per the application flow (e.g. Do not ask user to retry in case of any terminal state in the app)

## Navigations

- [ ] Back button
- [ ] Sortnig on columns (In case of a list/table control)
- [ ] Pagination (Move forward on last or move backward on first)

## Security

- [ ] SQL Injections
- [ ] App should never show sensitive db, server informations
- [ ] App should handle different user roles and ensure correct information is displayed to the user with his role/priviledges
- [ ] Local storage should not show sensitive information

## Performance

How responsive is the app when:

- [ ] When too many apps are open
- [ ] When app is used in low memory configs/devices
- [ ] Normal load
- [ ] X times normal load
- [ ] Extremely high load from concurrent users

## Backend responses and conditions

- [ ] Status codes check
- [ ] 2XX (Success)
- [ ] 3XX (Redirects)
- [ ] 4XX (Client side errors - Bad requests)
- [ ] 5XX (Server side errors)
- [ ] Does the app block the user from proceeding when waiting for an API when not needed?
- [ ] Does the app engage user while waiting for an API response (with an animation/loader)
- [ ] How the app handles when the API times out?
- [ ] How the app handles cases when server is undergoing deployments?

## Usability

How easy and friendly is the UI for use?

- [ ] Text/font are readable in different mobile sizes
- [ ] Font colors should enhance readibility
- [ ] Show numeric numpad when nos have to be entered
- [ ] Correct use of colors should be made on UI controls
- [ ] Spelling and grammar
- [ ] Localization
- [ ] Links should not be broken
- [ ] Scroll bars should be displayed when needed
- [ ] Scroll bars should be hidden when not needed

## Accessibility

Think how the app can be friendly to people with deficiences (Blind, deaf, dumb, vision related issues)

- [ ] App should be accessible via screen readers / voice commands
- [ ] Accessibility ids should be available with valid text
- [ ] Color should not be relied upon as the single way of identifying content (meaningful texts)
- [ ] Clearly shows when an object on the screen is active
- [ ] Links/buttons with same text but different targets should be uniquely identifiable
- [ ] Sufficient instructions for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Sound/video should have text alternatives to explain context
- [ ] Contrast of texts, icons, images should be accessible to people with vision deficiences
- [ ] User should get prompted if a flow gets timed out
